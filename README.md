Description:
This is a weather application that contains only 5 locations (Bucharest, Timisoara, Arad, Sibiu and Oradea). 
It consists of a dropdown button, where the user can choose a city that shows the current weather for the selected location and displays the weather on a 5-day forecast basis. 
When you scroll down halfway through the viewport a button will appear in the lower right corner. 
When the button is clicked, it scrolls to the top of the page.
